# SandPond
SandPond is an engine for atoms that follow spatial rules.

💡 It's heavily inspired by Dave Ackley's [T2 Tile Project](https://t2tile.org/).

🎥 For more info, check out the [SandPond Saga](https://youtube.com/c/TodePond) video series.

## Rules
Atoms follow simple rules, like this one:
```
@ => _
_    @
```
The `@` represents the atom.<br>
The `_` represents an empty space.<br>
So... the rule makes the atom fall down if there's an empty space below it.<br>
